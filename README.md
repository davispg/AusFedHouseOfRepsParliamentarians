AusFedHouseOfRepsParliamentarians
=================================

A python script which creates a JSON and CSV file of all Australian Federal House of Representative parliamentarians since federation.

Objective:
Build a JSON and CSV structure providing a history of Australian Federal Houst of Representatives parliamentarians in one place.

Source of Data:
I looked through a range of possible data sources, including Australia's own Australian Electoral Commission. The advantage of Wikipedia in my opinion was the ability to link to a page providing information on each elected parliamentarian.

Method:
I've used Python as I think, for the purposes of text manipulation, it is pretty good.

Dependencies:
This script depends on Beautiful Soup 4 and a range of other Python libraries. Refer to the Import section.

Testing:
I've run this script numerous times across Parliaments 1 through 44. You'll find in the code adjustments where particular Wikipedia tables have a different structure to other pages.

Future enhancements:
I intend to eventually extend this to linking to richer bibliographic resources and other meta data as time permits.
